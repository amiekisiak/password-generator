# password-generator


## Description

The purpose of this challenge is to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. The password length must be between 10 and 64 characters.

The password should include:
- lowercase characters
- uppercase characters
- numeric characters
- special characters

I have modified the starter code and my aim was to make it clear, simple and consistent.
